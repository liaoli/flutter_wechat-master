## Common issues

Please search common issues in [GitHub issues][]
for build errors, runtime exceptions, etc.

## Prepare for use

### Add the plugin reference to pubspec.yaml

Two ways to add the plugin to your pubspec:
- **(Recommend)** Run `flutter pub add photo_manager`. 
- Add the plugin reference in your `pubspec.yaml`'s `dependencies` section:
```yaml
dependencies:
  photo_manager: $latest_version
```

The latest stable version is:
[![pub package](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/photo_manager.svg)][pub package]

### Import in your projects

```dart
import 'package:photo_manager/photo_manager.dart';
```

### Configure native platforms

Minumum platform versions:
**Android 16, iOS 9.0, macOS 10.15**.

- Android: [Android config preparation](#android-config-preparation).
- iOS: [iOS config preparation](#ios-config-preparation).
- macOS: Pretty much the same with iOS.

#### Android config preparation

##### Kotlin, Gradle, AGP

Starting from 1.2.7, We ship this plugin with
**Kotlin `1.5.21`** and **Android Gradle Plugin `4.1.0`**.
If your projects use a lower version of Kotlin/Gradle/AGP,
please upgrade them to a newer version.

More specifically:
- Upgrade your Gradle version (`gradle-wrapper.properties`)
  to `6.8.3` or the latest version.
- Upgrade your Kotlin version (`ext.kotlin_version`)
  to `1.5.30` or the latest version.

##### Android 10+ (Q, 29)

_If you're compiling or targeting with an Android version that belows 29, you can skip this section._

On Android 10, **Scoped Storage** was introduced,
which causes the origin resource file inaccessible.

If your `compileSdkVersion` is above 29, you must add
`android:requestLegacyExternalStorage="true"` to your
`AndroidManifest.xml` in order to obtain resources:

```xml
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="com.fluttercandies.photo_manager_example">

    <application
        android:label="photo_manager_example"
        android:icon="@mipmap/ic_launcher"
        android:requestLegacyExternalStorage="true">
    </application>
</manifest>
```

##### Glide

The plugin use [Glide][] to create thumbnail bytes for Android.

If you found some warning logs with Glide appearing,
it means the main project needs an implementation of `AppGlideModule`.
See [Generated API][] for the implementation.

#### iOS config preparation

Define the `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription`
key-value in the `ios/Runner/Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>In order to access your photo library</string>
```

If you want to grant only write-access to the photo library on iOS 11 and above,
define the `NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription`
key-value in the `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
It's pretty much the same as the `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription`.

![permissions in Xcode](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CaiJingLong/some_asset/master/flutter_photo2.png)

## Usage

### Request for permission

Most of APIs can only use with granted permission.

```dart
final PermissionState _ps = await PhotoManager.requestPermissionExtend();
if (_ps.isAuth) {
  // Granted.
} else {
  // Limited(iOS) or Rejected, use `==` for more precise judgements.
  // You can call `PhotoManager.openSetting()` to open settings for further steps.
}
```

But if you're pretty sure your callers will be only called
after the permission is granted, you can ignore permission checks:

```dart
PhotoManager.setIgnorePermissionCheck(true);
```

#### Limited entities access on iOS

With iOS 14 released,
Apple broughts a "Limited Photos Library" to iOS.
So use the `PhotoManager.requestPermissionExtend()`
to request permissions.
The method will return `PermissionState`.
See [PHAuthorizationStatus][] for more detail.

To reselect accessible entites for the app,
use `PhotoManager.presentLimited()` to call the modal of
accessible entities management.
This method only available for iOS 14+ and when the permission state
is limited (`PermissionState.limited`),
other platform won't make a valid call.

### Get albums/folders (`AssetPathEntity`)

Albums or folders are abstracted as the [`AssetPathEntity`][] class.
It represent a bucket in the `MediaStore` on Android,
and the `PHAssetCollection` object on iOS/macOS.
To get all of them:

```dart
final List<AssetPathEntity> paths = await PhotoManager.getAssetPathList();
```

See [`getAssetPathList`][] for more detail.

### Get assets (`AssetEntity`)

Assets (images/videos/audios) are abstracted as the [`AssetEntity`][] class.
It represents a series of fields with `MediaStore` on Android,
and the `PHAsset` object on iOS/macOS.

#### From `AssetPathEntity`

You can use [the pagination method][`getAssetListPaged`]:
```dart
final List<AssetEntity> entities = await path.getAssetListPaged(page: 0, size: 80);
```
Or use [the range method][`getAssetListRange`]:
```dart
final List<AssetEntity> entities = await path.getAssetListRange(start: 0, end: 80);
```

#### From ID

The ID concept represents:
* The ID field of the `MediaStore` on Android.
* The `localIdentifier` field of the `PHAsset` on iOS.

You can store the ID if you want to implement features
that's related to presistent selections.
Use [`AssetEntity.fromId`][] to retrieve the entity
once you persist an ID.

```dart
final AssetEntity? asset = await AssetEntity.fromId(id);
```

Be aware that the created asset might have
limited access or got deleted in anytime,
so the result might be null.

#### From raw data

You can create your own entity from raw data,
such as downloaded images, recorded videos, etc.
The created entity will shown as a corresponing resource
on your device's gallery app.

```dart
final Uint8List rawData = yourRawData;

// Save an image to an entity from `Uint8List`.
final AssetEntity? entity = await PhotoManager.editor.saveImage(
  rawData,
  title: 'write_your_own_title.jpg', // Affects EXIF reading.
);

// Save an existed image to an entity from it's path.
final AssetEntity? imageEntityWithPath = await PhotoManager.editor.saveImageWithPath(
  path, // Use the absolute path of your source file, it's more like a copy method.
  title: 'same_as_above.jpg',
);

// Save a video entity from `File`.
final File videoFile = File('path/to/your/video.mp4');
final AssetEntity? videoEntity = await PhotoManager.editor.saveVideo(
  videoFile, // You can check whether the file is exist for better test coverage.
  title: 'write_your_own_title.mp4',
);
```

Be aware that the created asset might have
limited access or got deleted in anytime,
so the result might be null.

#### From iCloud

Resources might be saved only on iCloud to save disk space.
When retrieving file from iCloud, the speed is depend on the network condition,
which might be very slow that makes users feel anxious.
To provide a responsive user interface, you can use `PMProgressHandler`
to retrieve the progress when load a file.

The preferred implementation would be the [`LocallyAvailableBuilder`][]
in the `wechat_asset_picker` package, which provides a progress indicator
when the file is downloading.

#### Display assets

The plugin provided the `AssetEntityImage` widget and
the `AssetEntityImageProvider` to display assets:

```dart
final Widget image = AssetEntityImage(
  yourAssetEntity,
  isOriginal: false, // Defaults to `true`.
  thumbnailSize: const ThumbnailSize.square(200), // Preferred value.
  thumbnailFormat: ThumbnailFormat.jpeg, // Defaults to `jpeg`.
);

final Widget imageFromProvider = Image(
  image: AssetEntityImageProvider(
    yourAssetEntity,
    isOriginal: false,
    thumbnailSize: const ThumbnailSize.square(200),
    thumbnailFormat: ThumbnailFormat.jpeg,
  ),
);
```

#### Obtain "Live Photos"

This plugin supports obtain live photos and filtering them:

##### Filtering only "Live Photos"

This is supported when filtering only image.

```dart
final List<AssetPathEntity> paths = await PhotoManager.getAssetPathList(
  type: RequestType.image,
  filterOption: FilterOptionGroup(onlyLivePhotos: true),
);
```

##### Obtain the video from "Live Photos"

```dart
final AssetEntity entity = livePhotoEntity;
final String? mediaUrl = await entity.getMediaUrl();
final File? imageFile = await entity.file;
final File? videoFile = await entity.fileWithSubtype;
final File? originImageFile = await entity.originFile;
final File? originVideoFile = await entity.originFileWithSubtype;
```

#### Limitations

##### Android 10 media location permission

Due to the privacy policy issues on Android 10,
it is necessary to grant the location permission
to obtain the original data with the location info
and the EXIF metadata.

If you want to use the location permission,
add the `ACCESS_MEDIA_LOCATION` permission to your manifest.

##### Usage of the original data

The `originFile` and `originBytes` getter
will return the original data of an entity.
However, there are some cases that the original data is invalid in Flutter.
Here are some common cases:
* HEIC files are not fully supported across platforms. We suggest you to
  upload the JPEG file (99% quality compressed thumbnail) in order to keep
  a consistent behavior between multiple platforms.
  See [flutter/flutter#20522][] for more detail.
* Videos will only be obtained in the original format,
  not the exported/composited format, which might cause
  some behavior difference when playing videos.

##### Long retrieving duration with file on iOS

There are several I/O methods in this library targeting `AssetEntity`,
typically they are:
- All methods named with `file`.
- `AssetEntity.originBytes`.

File retrieving and caches are limited by the sandbox mechanisim on iOS.
An existing `PHAsset` doesn't mean the file located on the device.
In generall, a `PHAsset` will have three status:
- `isLocallyAvailable` equals `true`, **also cached**: Available for obtain.
- `isLocallyAvailable` equals `true`, **but not cached**: When you call I/O methods,
  the resource will first cached into the sandbox, then available for obtain.
- `isLocallyAvailable` equals `false`: Typically this means the asset exists,
  but it's saved only on iCloud, or some videos that not exported yet.
  In this case, the best practise is to use the `PMProgressHandler`
  to provide a responsive user interface.

### Entities change notify

Plugin will post entities change events from native,
but they will include different contents.
See [the `logs` folder](log) for more recorded logs.

To register a callback for these events, use
[`PhotoManager.addChangeCallback`] to add a callback,
and use [`PhotoManager.removeChangeCallback`] to remove the callback,
just like `addListener` and `removeListener` methods.

After you added/removed callbacks, you can call
[`PhotoManager.startChangeNotify`] method to enable to notify,
and [`PhotoManager.stopChangeNotify`] method to stop notify.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/services.dart';

void changeNotify(MethodCall call) {
  // Your custom callback.
}

/// Register your callback.
PhotoManager.addChangeCallback(changeNotify);

/// Enable change notify.
PhotoManager.startChangeNotify();

/// Remove your callback.
PhotoManager.removeChangeCallback(changeNotify);

/// Disable change notify.
PhotoManager.stopChangeNotify();
```

## Cache mechanism

### Cache on Android

Because Android 10 restricts the ability to access the resource path directly,
some large image caches will be generated during I/O processes.
More specifically, when the `file`, `originFile`
and any other I/O getters are called,
the plugin will save a file in the cache folder for further use.

Fortunately, in Android 11, the resource path can be obtained directly again,
but for Android 10, we can only use
`requestLegacyExternalStorage` as a workaround.
See [Android 10 extra configs](#android-10-extra-configs)
for how to add the attribute.

### Cache on iOS

iOS does not directly provide APIs to access the original files of the album.
So a cached file will be generated locally
into the container of the current application
when you called `file`, `originFile` and any other I/O getters.

If occupied disk spaces are sensitive in your use case,
you can delete it after your usage has done (iOS only).

```dart
import 'dart:io';

Future<void> useEntity(AssetEntity entity) async {
  File? file;
  try {
    file = await entity.file;
    handleFile(file!); // Custom method to handle the obtained file.
  } finally {
    if (Platform.isIOS) {
      file?.deleteSync(); // Delete it once the process has done.
    }
  }
}
```

### Clear caches

You can use the `PhotoManager.clearFileCache()` method
to clear all caches that generated by the plugin.
Here are caches generatation on different'
platforms, types and resolutions.

| Platform  | Thumbnail | File / Origin File |
|-----------| --------- | ------------------ |
| Android   | Yes       | No                 |
| iOS       | No        | Yes                |

## Native extra configs

### Android extra configs

#### Glide issues

If your found any conflicting issues against Glide,
then you'll need to edit the `android/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
rootProject.allprojects {
    subprojects {
        project.configurations.all {
            resolutionStrategy.eachDependency { details ->
                if (details.requested.group == 'com.github.bumptech.glide'
                        && details.requested.name.contains('glide')) {
                    details.useVersion '4.11.0'
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

See [ProGuard for Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide#proguard)
if you want to know more about using ProGuard and Glide together.

### iOS extra configs

#### Localized system albums name

By default, iOS will retrieve system album names only in English
no matter what language has been set to devices.
To change the default language, see the following steps:

* Open your iOS project (Runner.xcworkspace) using Xcode.
![Edit localizations in Xcode 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CaiJingLong/some_asset/master/iosFlutterProjectEditinginXcode.png)

* Select the project "Runner" and in the localizations table, click on the + icon.
![Edit localizations in Xcode 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CaiJingLong/some_asset/master/iosFlutterAddLocalization.png)

* Select the adequate language(s) you want to retrieve localized strings.
* Validate the popup screen without any modification.
* Rebuild your flutter project.

Now system albums label should display accordingly.

### Experimental features

**Warning**: Features here aren't guaranteed to be fully usable
since they involved with data modification.
They can be modified/removed in any time,
without following a proper version semantic.

Some APIs will make irreversible modification/deletion to datas.
**Please be careful and implement your own test mechanism when using them**.

#### Preload thumbnails

You can preload thumbnails for entites with specified thumbnail options
using [`PhotoCachingManager.requestCacheAssets`][]
or `PhotoCachingManager.requestCacheAssetsWithIds`.

```dart
PhotoCachingManager().requestCacheAssets(assets: assets, option: option);
```

And you can stop in anytime by calling
`PhotoCachingManager().cancelCacheRequest()`.

Usually, when we're previewing assets, thumbnails will be use.
But sometimes we want to preload assets to make them display faster.

The `PhotoCachingManager` uses the [PHCachingImageManager][] on iOS,
and Glide's file cache on Android.

#### Delete entities

**This method will delete the asset completely from your device.
Use it with extra cautious.**

```dart
// Deleted IDs will returned, if it fails, the result will be an empty list.
final List<String> result = await PhotoManager.editor.deleteWithIds(
  <String>[entity.id],
);
```

After the delection, you can call the `refreshPathProperties` method
to refresh the corresponding `AssetPathEntity` in order to get latest fields.

#### Copy an entity

You can use `copyAssetToPath` method to "Copy" an entity
from its current position to the targeting `AssetPathEntity`:

```dart
// Make sure your path entity is accessible.
final AssetPathEntity anotherPathEntity = anotherAccessiblePath;
final AssetEntity entity = yourEntity;
final AssetEntity? newEntity = await PhotoManager.editor.copyAssetToPath(
  asset: entity,
  pathEntity: anotherPathEntity,
); // The result could be null when the path is not accessible.
```

The "Copy" means differently here on Android and iOS:
- For Android, it inserts a copy of the source entity:
  - On platforms <=28, the method will copy most of the origin info.
  - On platforms >=29, some fields cannot be modified during the insertion,
    e.g. [MediaColumns.RELATIVE_PATH][].
- For iOS, it makes a shortcut thing rather than create a new physical entity.
  - Some albums are smart albums, their content is automatically managed
    by the system and cannot inserted entities manually.

(For Android 30+, this feature is blocked by system limitations currently.)

#### Features for Android only

##### Move an entity to another album

```dart
// Make sure your path entity is accessible.
final AssetPathEntity pathEntity = accessiblePath;
final AssetEntity entity = yourEntity;
await PhotoManager.editor.android.moveAssetToAnother(
  entity: entity,
  target: pathEntity,
);
```

(For Android 30+, this feature is blocked by system limitations currently.)

##### Remove all non-exist entities

This will remove all items (records) that's not existed locally.
A record in Android `MediaStore` could have the corresponding file deleted.
Those abnormal behaviors usually caused by operations from
file manager, helper tools or adb tool.
This operation is resource-consuming,
Please use the `await` keyword to call the cleaning process
before you call another one.

```dart
await PhotoManager.editor.android.removeAllNoExistsAsset();
```

Some operating systems will prompt confirmation dialogs
for each entities' deletion, we have no way to avoid them.
Make sure your customers accept repeatly confirmations.

#### Features for iOS only

##### Create a folder

```dart
PhotoManager.editor.iOS.createFolder(
  name,
  parent: parent, // Null, the root path or accessible folders.
);
```

##### Create an album

```dart
PhotoManager.editor.iOS.createAlbum(
  name,
  parent: parent, // Null, the root path or accessible folders.
);
```

##### Remove the entity entry from the album

Remove the entry of the asset from the specific album.
The asset won't be deleted from the device, only removed from the album.

```dart
// Make sure your path entity is accessible.
final AssetPathEntity pathEntity = accessiblePath;
final AssetEntity entity = yourEntity;
final List<AssetEntity> entities = <AssetEntity>[yourEntity, anotherEntity];
// Remove single asset from the album.
// It'll call the list method as the implementation.
await PhotoManager.editor.iOS.removeInAlbum(
  yourEntity,
  accessiblePath,
);
// Remove assets from the album in batches.
await PhotoManager.editor.iOS.removeAssetsInAlbum(
  entities,
  accessiblePath,
);
```

##### Delete a path entity

Smart albums can't be deleted.

```dart
PhotoManager.editor.iOS.deletePath();
```
